# Deep Learning model: LSTM based network
## README
Scripts for data preparation, network structure, training and evaluation can be found in `Model/`.
Main function can be seen in `Notebook_main.ipynb`, or `__main__.py`. A combination of modules in `Model/` and main function can be found in `Notebook_all.ipynb`.
